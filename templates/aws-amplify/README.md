## AWS Amplify Hosting Setup

After having run the `create-remix` command and selected "AWS Amplify" as a deployment target, you only need to [import your Git repository](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home) into AWS Amplify Hosting, and it will be deployed.

## Development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!
